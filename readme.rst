A collection of shell scripts written by me and my friends for convenience.

* mvln.sh: mv to a new location, leaving behind symlinks.
* minecraft-fixer.sh: update Minecraft's included lwjgl version
* tz_clocks.sh: display clocks for one or more timezones.
* prettify: prettify an IRC log (run run_prettify.py directly, or install with
  setuptools/distribute).
